# MSOffice-Test-Server
Test server to explore Microsoft Office link handling

## Prerequisites

Node. That's it! Not sure minimum version, I used 12.14.1. The server is extremely simple and just requires basic functionality from the built-in `http` and `fs` modules.

## Instructions

Clone repository and run `node .` to start the server. Then navigate to the URL listed in the console output. The home page should give hints for how to use the server.
